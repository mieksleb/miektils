Welcome to MIEKTILS, a collection of utlitities for DNA simulations. Most scripts (if they work) are compatible with oxDNA simulations.

MIEKTILS includes PAKTEP which consists of post-processing tools built in Fortran90 including Twist, Writhe, Persistence Length and Plectoneme position.

AMBERMIEK is a collection of tools used for generating files for all atom simulations of dsDNA in Amber.

Other oxDNA related python scripts can be found in the oxDNA directory.

Finally WLC is a series of python scripts which calculate the energy and plot the parametric forms of homogeneous and inhomogeneous elastica.
